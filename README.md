## :dart: Goal

Omnifood came to bring quality flavor, but with a friendly price, for those who know how to appreciate the delicious art of cooking, taking health into account above all.

## :scroll: Some details

* The front end is made with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

## :thinking: How do I run the project on my machine?

The first step is to clone the project, either via terminal or GitHub Desktop, or even by downloading the compressed file (.zip). After that, go ahead.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Requirements

There are no requirements to run the project on your computer! Just double click on the *index.html* file and it will open in your default browser.

## :tada: If everything went well...

Now you are running the project beautifully!
